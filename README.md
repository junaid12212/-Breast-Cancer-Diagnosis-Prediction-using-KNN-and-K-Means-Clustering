# -Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction-using-KNN-and-K-Means-Clustering

Problem: 
The goal of this project is to classify breast cancer cases using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means clustering.

Data Preprocessing:
The following preprocessing steps were performed to prepare the data for modeling:
1) Diagnosis Encoding:
The target variable diagnosis was converted into numerical form for model compatibility.Malignant tumors were encoded as 1, and benign tumors were encoded as 0.

2) Removal of Irrelevant Columns:
The id column was removed as it does not contribute to prediction.The Unnamed: 32 column contained only null values and was therefore dropped to avoid unnecessary noise.

3) Handling Missing Values:
The dataset was checked for missing or null values after column removal.Rows or columns with missing data were removed to maintain dataset integrity.

4) Feature Scaling (Min-Max Normalization):
All feature columns (excluding the diagnosis label) were scaled using Min-Max Normalization.This transformation scales feature values into the range [0, 1], ensuring that no single feature dominates the distance-based algorithms.Feature scaling is especially important for KNN and K-Means, as both algorithms rely on distance calculations.

5) Train-Test Split:
The dataset was split into 80% training data and 20% testing data.The training set was used for model learning, while the testing set was used for unbiased evaluation of model performance.

Algorithms used:
1) K-Nearest Neighbors (classification)
   A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and predicts the class based on the majority class of the nearest     neighbors
2) K-Means (clustering)
   An unsupervised learning algorithm and groups data into two clusters to analyze natural separation between malignant and      benign cases

Model Evaluation:
The KNN model was evaluated on the testing dataset using the following performance metrics:
-Accuracy: 0.9649
-Precision: 0.9535
-Recall: 0.9535
-F1-Score: 0.9535
The high accuracy and balanced precision and recall values indicate that the KNN classifier performs very well.
K-Means clustering also demonstrated meaningful separation of the two classes, supporting the dataset’s strong inherent structure.
